2.1 INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------

A standards organization is a body or entity responsible for creating and publishing standards to ensure consistency, quality, interoperability, and safety across various industries and sectors. These standards serve as guidelines, specifications, or protocols that establish common rules, practices, or benchmarks for products, services, and processes.  This reference resource provides a listing of intersecting standards development bodies.

2.2 STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS
-------------------------------

Standards organizations exist to promote efficiency and innovation by providing a foundation of technical specifications that enable compatibility and interoperability.

Some standards organizations operate at a global level, creating standards that apply internationally. Examples include the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the Open Geospatial Consortium. Others are regional or national, such as the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in the United States, Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE).
