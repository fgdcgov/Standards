NSDI – A Place-Based National Framework

Our world is increasingly complex and interconnected. Humanity is challenged with understanding and adjusting to ever-changing economic, environmental, and social factors.
Sustainable and innovative solutions depend on reliable information, understanding, and informed decision making.

Geographic information is a universal language that helps us intuitively understand and interpret conditions, events, relationships,
and patterns. It provides key information and context that helps define, influence, and guide our decisions and actions.

Whether it is understanding unfamiliar environments, determining the best route to a destination, or performing long-term
planning to enhance community resilience, the components of the NSDI are behind the scenes with the infrastructure to deliver data, tools, and information to people.


1.1. What is the NSDI?
-------------------------------

The NSDI provides a place-based framework for connecting public and private data for understanding and decision making.

A national framework for sharing place-based information.

.. NSDI Definition::
    The NSDI leverages investments in people, technology, data, and procedures to create and provide the geospatial knowledge required to understand, protect, and promote our national and global interests.

.. NSDI Evolution::

    The evolution of the NSDI framework pioneers place-based innovation for:
    •	Collaborative Partnerships
    •	Spatial Data Assets
    •	Shared Spatial Services and Tools
    •	Interoperable Infrastructure

1.2. The NSDI’s Connected Vision
-------------------------------

Place-Based Services for an Evolving World

Using spatial data, tools, and models to understand our ever-evolving world provides a worldwide recognized value. Place-based information is stimulating a local to global trillion dollar industry, bringing new jobs,
transforming organizations, and spurring market competition. Our Nation is a global leader in
the creation and dissemination of place-based assets and information.

    How will the NSDI shape our future?

    :Default: ``True``


Our Nation’s economic, social, and environmental future depends on the sound use of resources.
The NSDI’s connective framework, provided by the NDSI Strategic Plan, implements a collaborative, community-based model for sharing knowledge, data, technologies, and
 
standards that benefit our Nation. This aligns investments, coordinates acquisitions, shares tools, and drives innovation to support decision making. In turn, this increases opportunities to fuel economic growth and advantages for the United States.

The NSDI advances a future driven by place-based information services.

1.3 Connecting People and Communities
-------------------------------

Place-Based Information Links Communitie

Society is interconnected and interdependent. Local to global activities, events, and decisions affect us all, and bring new opportunities and challenges. The components of the NSDI enable people to work together as communities, sharing place-based information and tools to understand, prepare for and respond to challenges, and
seize opportunities. This is how the U.S. National Spatial Data Infrastructure advances the geospatial capabilities for the Nation.

    HHow do people and communities use the NSDI to leverage place-based information and tools?

    :Default: ``True``

The NSDI provides a rich set of spatial data, tools, and a supporting framework to facilitate and enable people to work together and collaborate as a community. The NSDI is based on the concept of interoperability. This helps users easily leverage resources being made available by others, and enables them to provide their own information and tools for others to use. It is a national cooperative framework.

An effective NSDI requires developing and utilizing partnerships that promote collaboration, cost-effectiveness, and
interoperable solutions. These components are the key underpinnings of the NSDI.
 
The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) works collaboratively with non-Federal partners, communities, constituents, and professional bodies providing the enabling foundation of standards, data catalogs, partnerships, and tools that make up the NSDI.

The NSDI ensures that place-based data from multiple sources (Federal, state, local, and tribal governments, academia, and the private sector) are available and easily integrated to enhance the understanding of our physical and cultural world.

    The NSDI provides a national, cooperative framework that allows access to data, tools and services.
