SDI Components
======================

NSDI Definition 
-------------------------------

Per the Geospatial Data Act of 2018, the National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) is defined as “… the technology, policies, criteria, standards, and employees necessary to promote geospatial data sharing throughout the Federal, State, Tribal, and local governments, and the private sector (including nonprofit organizations and institutions of higher education)”.

GDA requirements
-------------------------------

The NSDI “shall ensure that geospatial data from multiple sources (including the covered agencies, State, local and tribal governments, the private sector, and institutions of higher education) is available and easily integrated to enhance the understanding of the physical and cultural world.

The Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) shall prepare and maintain a strategic plan for the development and implementation of the NSDI; and, shall advise Federal and non-Federal users of geospatial data on their responsibilities relating to implementation of the NSDI. (43 U.S.C. Ch. 46 – Geospatial Data)

The NSDI Strategic Plan describes a shared national vision of the NSDI and includes goals and objectives the FGDC and partners will address to develop and maintain the nation’s spatial data infrastructure.
