FGDC-STD-006 Soil Geographic Data Standard
======================

Summary 
-------------------------------

The Soil Geographic Data Standard standardizes names, definitions, ranges of values, and other characteristics of soil survey map attribute data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS). Soil attribute data include physical and chemical properties, interpretative information, arrangement of soils into soil map units, and information about the soil map units themselves. The standard facilitates transfer and use of soil data and allows data users to receive data in a common format. It applies to tabular data associated with NCSS soil survey maps at scales of about 1:12,000 to 1:30,000. Data from individual points are classified using accepted procedures and grouped or aggregated into soil types. Soil types then become components of map units. The standard does not deal with description of landforms and landscapes or vegetation related to soil map units. It contains a list of data elements used to store physical, chemical, and interpretive data; an Entity Relationship Model; a list of table names with data elements contained in each; and a data dictionary.
