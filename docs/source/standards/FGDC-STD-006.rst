FGDC-STD-006 Soil Geographic Data Standard
======================

.. note:: This standard was approved by the FGDC in 1997. 

   The Geospatial Data Act of 2018 (GDA) establishes the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) as the lead entity in the executive branch of government for the development, implementation, and review of policies, practices, and standards relating to geospatial data. The GDA describes responsibilities related to geospatial standards for the FGDC and the agencies covered by the law (covered agencies). These responsibilities are reinforced by Office of Management and Budget Circular A-16 and OMB Circular A-119 (development and use of voluntary consensus standards). In the near future, FGDC will reestablish and resource a sustainable standards process, including implementing supporting governance requirements, updating and improving legacy processes, and validating standards for use as required under the GDA. Agencies should continue, to the extent possible in lieu of an active standards process, to develop, review, update, and achieve compliance with existing and pending standards, and become members of the appropriate FGDC standards body when active. (Approved by the FGDC 12/17/2021)

Summary 
-------------------------------

The Soil Geographic Data Standard standardizes names, definitions, ranges of values, and other characteristics of soil survey map attribute data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS). Soil attribute data include physical and chemical properties, interpretative information, arrangement of soils into soil map units, and information about the soil map units themselves. The standard facilitates transfer and use of soil data and allows data users to receive data in a common format. It applies to tabular data associated with NCSS soil survey maps at scales of about 1:12,000 to 1:30,000. Data from individual points are classified using accepted procedures and grouped or aggregated into soil types. Soil types then become components of map units. The standard does not deal with description of landforms and landscapes or vegetation related to soil map units. It contains a list of data elements used to store physical, chemical, and interpretive data; an Entity Relationship Model; a list of table names with data elements contained in each; and a data dictionary.
