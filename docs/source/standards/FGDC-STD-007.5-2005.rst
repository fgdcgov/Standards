FGDC-STD-007.5-2005 Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards, Part 5: Standards for Nautical Charting Hydrographic Surveys
======================

Summary
-------------------------------

Part 5 provides minimum standards for horizontal and vertical accuracy of features associated with hydrographic surveys that support nautical charting. Features include, but are not limited to, water depths, objects on the seafloor, navigational aids, and shoreline. Hydrographic surveys determine the configuration of the bottom of water bodies and identify and locate features that may affect navigation. Nautical charts are compilations of data from numerous sources, principally hydrographic surveys, designed specifically to meet the requirements of marine navigation. The scope of these standards includes the coastal waters of the U.S. and its territories.
