FGDC-STD-007.4-2002 Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards, Part 4: Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Facilities Management
======================

Summary
-------------------------------

PART 4 provides accuracy standards for engineering drawings, maps, and surveys that support planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, and management of facilities, installations, structures, transportation systems, and related projects. It supports geospatial mapping data used in various engineering documents, such as architectural, engineering, and construction (A/E/C) drawings, site plans, regional master planning maps, and related Geographical Information System (GIS), Computer-Aided Drafting and Design (CADD), and Automated Mapping/Facility Management (AM/FM) products. It defines accuracy criteria, accuracy testing methodology, and accuracy reporting criteria for object features depicted on A/E/C spatial data products and related control surveys. By using Part 4, end users of A/E/C products (e.g., planners, designers, constructors) can specify surveying and mapping accuracy requirements for their projects or specific CADD/GIS layers, levels, or entities. Data producers (e.g., surveyors, mappers, photogrammetrists) can determine instrumentation, procedures, and quality control processes required to obtain and verify the defined accuracies.
