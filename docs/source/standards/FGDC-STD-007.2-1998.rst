FGDC-STD-007.2-1998 Standards for Geodetic Networks 
======================

Geospatial Positioning Accuracy Standards, Part 2: Standards for Geodetic Networks

Summary
-------------------------------

Part 2 applies to accuracy reporting for geodetic networks. Geodetic control surveys establish a basic control network (framework) from which supplemental surveying and mapping work. They are performed to accuracy that is far more rigorous and quality assurance standards than those for control surveys for general engineering, construction, topographic mapping, or cadastral purposes.
