FGDC SDI Knowledge Directory!
===================================

Welcome to the SDI Knowledge Directory.

This directory is a collaborative project to bring together SDI information to advance national, regional and global SDI's.  

.. note::

   This project is under active development. 
   For the past three decades the FGDC has provided leadership in fostering collaboration and developing partnerships for the advancement of local-to-global SDI's.  We will continue to work to mobilize SDI information we have developed over the past 30 years into the SDI Knowledge Directory to serve the geospatial community.
