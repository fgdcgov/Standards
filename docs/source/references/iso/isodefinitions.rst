ISO (International Organization for Standardization) has developed a set of standards related to metadata, which are known as ISO Elements metadata standards. These standards provide guidelines and best practices for creating and managing metadata for various purposes, including data interchange, information retrieval, and data preservation. Here are some of the ISO metadata standards:
