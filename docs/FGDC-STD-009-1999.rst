Content Standard for Remote Sensing Swath Data 
======================

INTRODUCTION
-------------------------------

Objective
-------------------------------

The primary objective of this standard is to define the minimum content for remote sensing swath data (hereinafter called the swath data model).  This content standard will provide a solid basis for developing interoperable data formats for remote sensing swath data.

The standard has the following goals:
1.	To provide a common conceptual framework for encoding swath and swath-like data,
2.	To encourage interuse of swath and swath-like data through implementation of transfer standards within the conceptual framework,
3.	To involve non-federal organizations in the development of this standard, thereby encouraging broad applications.
